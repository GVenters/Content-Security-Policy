Content Security Policy (CSP) is a set of policies and headers used to help mitigate against 
cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks 
resulting from execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context.

It provides a standard method by which to declare the approved origin of content for embeddable objects such as javascript, css, fonts and images. 
Newer types of embeddable content such as web workers are also covered.

## Current Status
As at October 2016 Level 2 is a recommendation of the W3C working group on Web Application Security
https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/
Work is underway on level 3 CSP which is expected to supersede Level 2. At time of writing Level 3 has a status of working draft.

## Browser support
CSP is widely supported by modern web browsers.
